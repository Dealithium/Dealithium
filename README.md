### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Dealithium/Dealithium** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am attempting with no knowlege of code to create a multi-currency type wallet and exchange for a charity and charity app. My overall concept is to tie together different types of coins and tokens to provide funds for charity through a app as a game to add, trade and spend tokens to build the assets in the owner's wallet.

We are a 501(c)3 Charity and have a coin asset and some tokens with the CounterParty DEX system. We have a node up and running and tutorials on wallet generation for paper wallets on our web site at https://Dealithiumcoin.com 

Any help our suggestions would be great! Since we are a charity, we do not have a great deal of funds to hire at this point, but we would be willing to talk with anyone who wants to help and promote what we are doing. 
Our Charity publishing and missions ministry is at https://YahBible.Org and we do not contribute to just our own cause. We use KIVA an GUIDESTAR along with several other charity outlets with public transparency in Jewish and Christian resources to send funds to those in need in food, clothing, books and educational materials about Faith. 
We are Nondenominational which means we do not hold to one sect or religion as our oversight or except earthly leadership lording over us and telling us what to do. 

We believe in Yah God, Yahshua Messiah and keep 7 feast seasons of the Torah. We believe in baptism or the micvah bath or repentance. If you don't understand this then don't worry it has nothing to do with code for github but everything to do with a code of morals and faith. 

So we work in non-religious community service, missions within our own faith, and in other faiths to get aid, food, clothing and charity to those in need. We have missions work in Ukraine and in Philippines as well as work with Pastors and outreach programs in Central America and the United State. 

I will post my code here for public view or our DEALITHIUMCOIN build by WalletBuilders. We have tokens on the DEX of DEALITHIUM and REALDEALIUM on the Counterparty exchange linked on our web sites. 

We are in need of expert help to complete the following tasks and integrate our goals into a marketing plan:

1. Establish a  wallet and excahnge means to may owning and selling our DEALITHIUMCOIN a easy to use application for our congregation members and customers who support our charity ideas.
2. Get our crypto types into a commmon wallet app for google chrome extension and a wallet connet on our web site in Android, MS and Apple Mac formats. 
3. Create dispenser type methods with ease of use to buy our crypto:
a. BTC like
b. Counterparty like tokens
c. ERC20 Creations
4. Develope a gaming app that uses our tokens or coins to build toward earning our main like BTC like Coins and ERC20 ETH like Tokens to buil value and help our chairty to help others to need their needs in aid as stated above.

So if someone can help us to get a app to add us such as https://github.com/guardaco/guarda-android-wallets/ and help us get our apps built, or get added to other wallets and apps that will help us help others. Some other ideas are to get added to https://freewallet.org/partners 
We need to understand how to set up our EXPLORER for our BLOCKCHAIN DEALITHIUMCOIN so that we can have the needed bases to get our brand of coins into the market. 

Please feel free to contact me via our web connections and this site to add any assistance to our cause and charity. We are open to talking about small conculting fees or payment in kind with those willing to join our team.
